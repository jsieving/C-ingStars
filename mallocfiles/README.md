# Memory Allocator Implementation and Tests

"make" or "make test1" will compile jsmalloc and test1 which uses jsmalloc.

"make bigint" will compile jsmalloc and bigint which uses jsmalloc.

"make jsmalloc" will compile jsmalloc to a shared library (not recommended as it can't reliably be used in place of malloc)

"make clean" deletes files created by make.
