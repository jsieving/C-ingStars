# Implementation of Malloc with C
### Camille Xue and Jane Sieving

## Project Idea

For our project we will be making our own implementation of malloc, free, and realloc. Our lower bound is to have a working basic implementation of malloc. For our stretch goal we would improve our implementation and/or implement more of the features of malloc and the other memory functions. For example, we could try optimizing with different fit algorithms and coalescing.

## Learning Goals

*Camille:* I want to have a strong understanding of C, memory, and pointers.

*Jane:* I want to gain a better understanding of how C handles memory under the hood and what is required to efficiently and effectively handle memory. Iâ€™m also just interested in having to write my own version of something that works at a pretty low level.

## Resources

We have found some resources and tutorials on implementing malloc, so we think we have what we need to get started. Here are some of the resources we found:
1. http://csapp.cs.cmu.edu/3e/malloclab.pdf
2. https://danluu.com/malloc-tutorial/
3. https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~guna/15-123S11/Lectures/Lecture08.pdf
4. http://moss.cs.iit.edu/cs351/slides/slides-malloc.pdf

## First Steps

* Read through resources (resources #3 & 4 + others if useful) to understand what malloc, free, and realloc do and how they work conceptually (Both members)
  * Done when we both feel like we have a grasp on malloc & other memory functions
* Attempt/Complete the tutorial in the resources individually (resource #2)
  * Done when we have completed the tutorial or have reached a point we are unable to work past
* If we were unable to complete the tutorial, research how to get past the problem or find a different tutorial
  * Done when we have successfully created a basic implementation of malloc
* If/when we completed the tutorial successfully, research things we could add to or improve about the implementation and work on incorporating those
  * Stretch goal- definition of done will change as project unfolds
